#### rt-neural-lv2 ####

Is a simple headless lv2 plugin inspired by

- [NeuralPi](https://github.com/GuitarML/NeuralPi)
- [RTNeural](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/RTNeural.git)

This lv2 plugin is a simple wrapper to inference classes used in NeuralPi project. All
the credits to the original authors. I've decided to implement this plugin to be able to compile
original NeuralPi plugin without JUCE and also to eliminate every additional effect that has been
added during time.

__*WIP: currently this plugin is under work since CPU consumption is not acceptable, come back later!*__
